## Overview

- The GUI is written using React.js
- It provides facilities to:
  - Browse the artists, albums and track lists in the collection
  - Browse the register of audio equipment in the catalogue
  - Manage wish lists of albums and audio equipment
  - Perform album lookups, given an artist name and title
  - Export data to Excel workbook (XLSX) and CSV format
  - Report on the data in the catalogue
- The GUI uses the associated web service to retrieve and lookup data

## Configuration

- The UI uses a simple "config.json" file containing the base URL for the Music Catalogue web service and locale settings used by the UI and during address geocoding:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8098"
  },
  "region": {
    "locale": "en-GB",
    "currency": "GBP",
    "geocodingLanguage": "en",
    "geocodingRegion": "GB"
  }
}
```

## Login

- On browing to the application, the login dialog is displayed, prompting for a username and password
- This authenticates with the web service (see below), so a valid login in the local database is required
- Instructions on adding a user to the database are given in the "Database Users" section of the Wiki
